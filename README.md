# my-bashrc



This is my bashrc configuration with some improvements like full git support, it tells you what branch you're on, and with highlights and everything.

The red color represents your username.

White color represents intermediate letters and special characters.

The green color represents the hostname of the equipment.

The yellow color represents the directory you are in.

In the integration with git, it presents the branch you are in, both the master and other branches and if you have made any changes.

This is my bashrc just clone and work
